# Social Network API - Challenge 18

## Description
This project is the eighteenth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. 

Starting from scratch, this challenge required writing  code to do the following:
*   GIVEN a social network API

        - WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
        - THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

        - WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
        - THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

        - WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
        - THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

        - WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
        - THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
